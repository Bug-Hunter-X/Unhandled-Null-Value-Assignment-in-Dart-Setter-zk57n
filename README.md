# Unhandled Null Value Assignment in Dart Setter

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: failing to handle null values appropriately when assigning them to nullable member variables within setter methods.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the `setValue` method of the `MyClass`.  When a `null` value is passed to `setValue`, the `_value` member variable is directly assigned `null`, which might not be what's intended.  Depending on how `_value` is used later, this could lead to `NullPointerExceptions`.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a null check before assigning `newValue` to `_value`. The updated code is in `bugSolution.dart`.
